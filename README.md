# Furry-Friends

This website, created as a part of my web development course, is dedicated to helping pets find their forever homes. It offers two main features: one for people looking to give away pets and another for those looking to find a pet.

## Giving Away a Pet
If you are looking to give away a pet, simply click on the "Give Away a Pet" button on the homepage. You will then be asked to provide some basic information about your pet, such as its breed, age, and any special needs it may have. You can also upload a photo of your pet to help attract potential adopters.

Once you have provided all the necessary information, your pet will be added to the website's database of adoptable pets. Interested adopters can then browse through the listings and contact you directly if they are interested in adopting your pet.

##Finding a Pet
If you are looking to adopt a pet, simply click on the "Find a Pet" button on the homepage. You will then be able to search for pets based on various criteria, such as their breed, age, and location. You can also filter your search results to show only pets that are good with children, for example, or that are house trained.

Once you have found a pet that you are interested in adopting, you can contact the owner directly through the website to arrange a meeting and adoption.

##Improvments to be made
1) Improving the website's responsiveness so that users can access it from any device and have a seamless experience.
2) Enhancing the layout and design of the website to make it more visually appealing and user-friendly.
3) Using a comprehensive database like MySQL to store information about pets and their owners (currently using files as per course requirement) which would improve data management and website performance.
